Emencia Django Newsletter
=========================

The problematic was :

 *How to couple a contact base to a mailing list and sending newsletters throught Django ?*

Imagine that we have an application containing some kind of profiles or something like the **django.contrib.auth** and you want to send newsletters to them and tracking the activity.

.. contents::

Features
========

More than a long speech, here the list of the main features :

  * Coupling capacities with another django model.
  * Variables can be used in the newsletter's templates.
  * Mailing list managements (merging, importing...).
  * Import/Export of the contact in VCard 3.0.
  * Configurable SMTP servers with flow limit management.
  * Working groups.
  * Can send newsletter previews.
  * Subscriptions and unsubscriptions to mailing list.
  * Attachments in newsletters.
  * Unique urls for an user.
  * Tracking statistics.


Architecture
============

At the level of the application architecture, we can see 2 originalities who need to be explained.

Content types
-------------

The **content types** application is used to link any *Contact* model instance to another model instance.
This allow you to create different kinds of contact linked to differents application, and retrieve the association at anytime.

This is particulary usefull with the templates variables if certain informations are located in the model instance linked.

Cronjob/Command
---------------

The emencia.django.newsletter application will never send the newsletters registered in the site until you launch the **send_newsletter** command. ::

  $ python manage.py send_newsletter

This command will launch the newsletters who need to be launched accordingly to the credits of the SMTP server of the newsletter.
That's mean that not all newsletters will be expedied at the end of the command because if you use a public SMTP server you can be banished temporarly if you reach the sending limit.
To avoid banishment all the newsletters are not sended in the same time and immediately.

So it is recommanded to create a **cronjob** for launching this command every hours for example.

Installation
============

Dependencies
------------

Make sure to install these packages prior to installation :

 * Django >= 1.2
 * html2text
 * BeautifulSoup
 * django-tagging
 * vobject
 * xlwt
 * xlrd

The package below is optionnal but handy for rendering a webpage in your newsletter.

 * lxml

Getting the code
----------------

You could retrieve the last sources from http://github.com/Fantomas42/emencia-django-newsletter and running the installation script ::

  $ python setup.py install

or use pip ::

  $ pip install -e git://github.com/Fantomas42/emencia-django-newsletter.git#egg=emencia.django.newsletter

For the latest stable version use easy_install ::

  $ easy_install emencia.django.newsletter

Applications
------------

Then register **emencia.django.newsletter**, **admin**, **contenttypes** and **tagging** in the INSTALLED_APPS section of your project's settings. ::

  INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # Your favorites apps
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sites',
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'tagging',
    'emencia.django.newsletter',)


Urls
----

In your project urls.py adding this following line to include the newsletter's urls for serving the newsletters in HTML. ::

  url(r'^newsletters/', include('emencia.django.newsletter.urls')),

Note this urlset is provided for convenient usage, but you can do something like that if you want to customize your urls : ::

  url(r'^newsletters/', include('emencia.django.newsletter.urls.newsletter')),
  url(r'^mailing/', include('emencia.django.newsletter.urls.mailing_list')),
  url(r'^tracking/', include('emencia.django.newsletter.urls.tracking')),
  url(r'^statistics/', include('emencia.django.newsletter.urls.statistics')),

Media Files
-----------

You have to make a symbolic link from emencia/django/newsletter/media/edn/ directory to your media directory or make a copy named **edn**,
but if want to change this value, define NEWSLETTER_MEDIA_URL in the settings.py as appropriate.

Don't forget to serve this url.

Synchronization
---------------

Now you can run a *syncdb* for installing the models into your database.

Settings
--------

You have to add in your settings the email address used to send the newsletter : ::

  NEWSLETTER_DEFAULT_HEADER_SENDER = 'My NewsLetter <newsletter@myhost.com>'


DBMS considerations
===================

It's not recommended to use SQLite for production use. Because is limited to 999
variables into a SQL query, you can not create a Mailing List greater than this limitations
in the Django's admin modules. Prefer MySQL ou PgSQL.


HOWTO use WYSIWYG for editing the newsletters
=============================================

It can be usefull for the end user to have a WYSIWYG editor for the
creation of the newsletter. The choice of the WYSIWYG editor is free and
the described method can be applied for anything, but we will focus on
TinyMCE and CkEditor.

Either install the `django-tinymce <http://code.google.com/p/django-tinymce/>`_ application or the `django-ckeditor <https://github.com/shaunsephton/django-ckeditor/>`_ application into your project.

That's done, enjoy !


HOWTO couple your profile application with emencia.django.newsletter
====================================================================

If you wan to quickly import your contacts into a mailing list for example,
you can write an admin's action for your model.

We suppose that we have the fields *email*, *first_name* and *last_name* in a models name **Profile**.

In his AdminModel definition add this method and register it into the *actions* property. ::

  class ProfileAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):

      def make_mailing_list(self, request, queryset):
          from emencia.django.newsletter.models import Contact
          from emencia.django.newsletter.models import MailingList

          subscribers = []
          for profile in queryset:
              contact, created = Contact.objects.get_or_create(email=profile.mail,
                                                               defaults={'first_name': profile.first_name,
                                                                         'last_name': profile.last_name,
                                                                         'content_object': profile})
              subscribers.append(contact)
          new_mailing = MailingList(name='New mailing list',
                                    description='New mailing list created from admin/profile')
          new_mailing.save()
          new_mailing.subscribers.add(*subscribers)
          new_mailing.save()
          self.message_user(request, '%s succesfully created.' % new_mailing)
      make_mailing_list.short_description = 'Create a mailing list'

      actions = ['make_mailing_list']

This action will create or retrieve all the **Contact** instances needed for the mailing list creation.

After this you can send a newsletter to this mailing list.

Development
===========

A `Buildout
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout>`_ script is provided to properly initialize the project
for anybody who wants to contribute.

First of all, please use `VirtualEnv
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ to protect your system.

Follow these steps to start the development : ::

  $ git clone git://github.com/Fantomas42/emencia-django-newsletter.git
  $ virtualenv --no-site-packages emencia-django-newsletter
  $ cd emencia-django-newsletter
  $ source ./bin/activate
  $ python bootstrap.py
  $ ./bin/buildout

The buildout script will resolve all the dependancies needed to develop the application.

Once these operations are done, you are ready to develop on the project.

Run this command to launch the tests. ::

  $ ./bin/test

Or you can also launch the demo. ::

  $ ./bin/demo syncdb
  $ ./bin/demo runserver

Pretty easy no ?

Translations
------------
